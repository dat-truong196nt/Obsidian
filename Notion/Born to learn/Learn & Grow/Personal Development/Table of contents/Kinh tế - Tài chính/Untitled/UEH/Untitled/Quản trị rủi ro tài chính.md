CHAPTER 1: Introduction  
Terminologies:  
+ Business risk: uncertainty of future sales or the cost of inputs.  
+ Financial risk: interest, exchange rate, stock price, commodity price.  
+ OTC (over the counter): group exchange in private rather than a centralized exchange.  
+ Spot/Cash market: Transactions are made immediately with delivery assets.  
+ Options contract: Gives the right (not obligation) to call/put (buy/sell) something on a later day at a price today.  
+ Forward contract: An Options contract but with the obligation (instead of the right).  
+ Future contract: Forward contract but traded in futures markets, profit & loss updated every day.  
+ Swap contract: Swap cash flow (Interest rate, Currency, Commodity, Credit Default)  
  
Examples:  
+ Interest rate swap (  
A has a loan with 5% interest  
B has a loan with a floating rate (x + 1%)  
→ A swap interest with B in notional ($100 m)  
If x = 3%:  
A still pays 5m loan to the bank, but receives 1m (on nominal $100 m) from B.  
B pays 4m loan to the bank, but sends 1m (on nominal $100 m) to A.  
)  
+ Currency swap (  
A - American needs EUR 100m to open their biz in Europe.  
B - European needs USD 110m to open their biz in America.  
→ A swap currency with B  
Day 1: A sends B USD 110m, B sends A EUR 100m with spot rate.  
Annually, A pays B interest on EUR 100m, and B pays A interest on USD 110m.  
Day end: B pays A USD 110m, A pays B EUR 100m with spot rate at day 1  
)  
+ Commodity Swap (  
A wants a fixed price on oil.  
→ A signed contract with the bank at X price (volume)  
If price > X, the bank pays A (price - X) x volume  
If price < X, A pays the bank (X - price) x volume  
)  
+ Credit Default Swap (  
A owns $10m of X’s security.  
→ A signed contract $10m with the bank if X defaults (2% interest)  
If X does not default, A pays the bank $200k fee.  
If X defaults, X pays A $10m - (Current value of X)  
)  
  
Derivatives are financial contracts whose returns are derived from an underlying.  
Using derivatives to transfer an undesigned risk (with a price) to others who either have risks that offset it or who want to assume that risk.

+ Clean property rights  
+ Culture of trust
