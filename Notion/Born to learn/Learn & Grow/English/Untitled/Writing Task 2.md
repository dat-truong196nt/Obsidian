CONS  
Plastic is basically not poisonous or harmless. Yet, plastic bags are made of colours and dyes, metals and other inorganic chemicals which often have negative effects on health. Some of these bright colours are capable of making food substances toxic.Recently, research has revealed that heating the food in the plastic utensils and the water bottle kept in the car can cause cancer.

If plastic bags are not disposed properly, they make their way to the drainage

system, which in turn blocks drains and makes the environment unhealthy. This

also leads to aquatic/waterborn illnesses. In re-cycled or coloured plastic bags,

there are certain chemicals that dissolve and reach the ground and hence soil

and water on the earth can become toxic.

If plastic is recycled according to approved procedures and guidelines, then this

hazard/problem may not become a threat to environment and health. As an

alternative to plastic bags, jute, cloth and paper bags should be made popular and

significant financial incentives should also be provided to popularise/encourage their use
