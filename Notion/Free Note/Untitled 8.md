## **Presentation Outline: STAMP/STPA for Data Engineering**

### **1. Introduction (5 min)**

- **What is STAMP/STPA?**
    - STAMP: Focuses on safety as a control problem, not just component failures.
    - STPA: The analysis technique to identify hazards, unsafe control actions, and design safety constraints.
- Why should **Data Engineering teams care?**
    - Data pipelines handle sensitive data, critical business logic, compliance (GDPR, PII, financial data).
    - Failures = Data loss, compliance breaches, or wrong decision-making.

### **2. Core Concepts of STAMP/STPA (5 min)**

- **Control Structure**: System seen as controllers, actuators, sensors, controlled processes.
- **Unsafe Control Actions (UCAs)**: Actions that, in certain contexts, can lead to hazards.
- **Safety Constraints**: Rules/requirements that prevent unsafe outcomes.

_Example for Data Engineering:_

- Controller: ETL orchestration job (e.g., Databricks Workflow)
- Controlled Process: Data warehouse
- Actuators: Spark job writes, deletes
- Hazards: Writing corrupted data, deleting active table partitions

### **3. Applying STPA in Data Engineering (10 min)**

**Step 1: Define Purpose & Losses**

- Loss: Data breach of PII, compliance failure, financial misreporting.

**Step 2: Identify Hazards**

- E.g., “Data pipeline writes incomplete data to production due to partial upstream load.”

**Step 3: Build Control Structure Diagram**

- Show architecture: Ingestion → Transformation → Storage → Consumption
- Controllers: Orchestration tool (Airflow/Databricks), Schema Registry, Monitoring system.

**Step 4: Identify Unsafe Control Actions**

- “Stop ingestion when it should continue”
- “Delete data before downstream confirmation”
- “Release schema changes without validation”

**Step 5: Define Safety Constraints**

- “All schema changes must pass automated validation pipeline.”
- “Pipeline cannot overwrite production partition unless reconciliation is complete.”

### **4. Real Example: STPA in a Data Pipeline (15 min)**

### **5. How STPA Guides Solution/Architecture Design (10 min)**

- Introduce **control loops in architecture**:
    - Monitoring → Alerts → Human-in-the-loop approval
- Integrate with existing patterns:
    - Data contracts (schema + expectations)
    - CI/CD pipeline gates (unit tests, data validation)
    - PII tagging with automated lineage

---

### **6. Benefits for Data Engineering (5 min)**

- **Proactive risk mitigation** vs reactive firefighting
- Improves compliance and audit readiness
- Encourages **systems thinking**: People, processes, and tech work as one

---

### **7. Q&A and Next Steps (5 min)**

- Questions from team
- Suggested next step: Pilot STPA on **one critical workflow**
- Resources: STAMP handbook, MIT STPA tutorial
